# Graphene Band Structure (Tight-Binding)

Python implementation of the tight-binding band structure of graphene,
including 2D contours, 3D band surfaces, and dispersion along
high-symmetry paths (Γ–M–K–Γ).

## Features
- 2D energy contour plots
- 3D band structure visualization
- Band dispersion along high-symmetry paths

## Theory
Nearest-neighbor tight-binding model for graphene.
